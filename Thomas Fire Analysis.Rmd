## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(praise)



```

```{r}
read_excel("144l_students/Input_Data/week1/2013_2019_CALFIRE_Redbook.xlsx")
Fire <- read_excel("144l_students/Input_Data/week1/2013_2019_CALFIRE_Redbook.xlsx", sheet = "Data")
View(Fire)
```

```{r}
df1 <- select(Fire, Fire_Name, Start_Date, Controlled_Date, Total_Acres_Burned, County_Unit)
head(df1)

```

```{r}
df2 <- filter(Fire, County_Unit  %in% c("LOS ANGELES", "SAN DIEGO", "VENTURA/SANTA BARBARA" ) & 
                Total_Acres_Burned > 1000) 

View(df2)
Thomas <- filter(df2, Fire_Name %in% c("THOMAS", "BASILONE COMPLEX", "CREEK", "SAND"))
glimpse(Thomas)

```


```{r}
ggplot(Thomas, aes(x = Fire_Name, y = Total_Acres_Burned))+
  geom_point(aes(color = County_Unit))+
  ggtitle("Thomas Fire Comparisons")
